ImageGrabber is a Scrapy demo for downloading images from a website.

This is a simplified version of my original one, I removed the validation and database supporting parts and share the rest with others who are looking
for some examples to kick start their own Scrapy project.

The URLs in the source is just placeholders, you need to change to your own's.

BTW, I am rather new to Python, so don't expect too much from me.
